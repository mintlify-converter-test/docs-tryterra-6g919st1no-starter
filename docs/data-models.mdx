Data Models

## Overview

Our data models are at the core of what makes Terra easy to use; no matter which of our providers you want to connect to, you can expect the same formats and units.

There are eight fundamental data models:

*   [TerraUser](/reference/v2#terrauser)
     - a Terra User object, equivalent to one wearable connection
*   [Activity](/reference/v2#activity-1)
     - workouts performed during a given time period
*   [Athlete](/reference/v2#athlete)
     - user identifying information (first name, last name, email etc.)
*   [Body](/reference/v2#body)
     - body metrics of the user for a given time period
*   [Daily](/reference/v2#daily)
     - summary of the user's daily activity metrics
*   [Menstruation](/reference/v2#menstruation)
     - the user's menstruation data for a given time period
*   [Nutrition](/reference/v2#nutrition)
     - nutrition data such as micronutrients, macronutrients, and foods consumed
*   [Sleep](/reference/v2#sleep)
     - data recorded pertinent to a sleep session for the user

For all data models other than `TerraUser` and `Athlete`, one instance of a data model holds aggregate data over a specific time period (defined by a `start-time` and `end-time`). The individual datapoints collected over the time period is also available in the form of an array of [`Samples`](/reference/v2#samples)
 .

Data which takes non-numeric, discrete values (e.g. `ActivityType`, `StrokeType`) are modelled as [`Enums`](/reference/enums)
.

For more in-depth explanations and examples, please refer to the [Data Models](/reference/v2)
 section.
